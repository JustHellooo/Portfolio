<p>Hi! Here's a little bit about me! My resume can be found below.</p>
<p>
  I'm a selftaught web developer. I've spent time learning HTML, JavaScript, and
  CSS. I have knowledge in C# as well. With a degree in National Security
  Studies and a previous aspiration to work in federal law enforcement, I
  naturally changed tracks to work in web development. I love the opportunity to
  be creative and solve problems. I truly believe I've found my passion, and I
  love it. Oh... and yes I'm in love with the 49ers.
